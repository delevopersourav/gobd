Igor Kholkin, founder of a top-ranked SEO agency, notes that his company frequently contracts writers who post great content on other sites. “This allows us to hire writers whose portfolio is already amazing, without having to vet candidates who apply. This, however, depend upon your quality of work since not every writer is selected for publication. Though your byline is presented for those articles and you’re no longer a ghostwriter.
